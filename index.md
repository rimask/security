<dd>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} administrators ensure that fixes for operating systems are applied at appropriate frequencies. Automated fixes are enabled by using IBM Endpoint Manager.</dd>

<dt>Audit log consolidation and analysis</dt>
<dd>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} uses the IBMSecurity QRadar® tools to consolidate Linux logs to monitor privileged access on Linux systems. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also uses IBM QRadar security information and event management (SIEM) to monitor successful and unsuccessful login attempts of application developers.</dd>

<dt>User access management</dt>
<dd>Within {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, Separation of Duties guidelines is followed to assign granular access privileges to users, and to ensure that users have only the access that is required to perform their jobs according to the principle of least privilege.

Within {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated and Local environments, assigned administrators can manage roles and permissions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} users in their organization by using the Admin Console. See [Managing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}](/docs/hybrid/index.html#mng) for details.
</dd>
</dl>

### Physical security

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public and Dedicated rely on the network-within-a-network topology of {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} for physical Network security. This network-within-a-network architecture ensures that systems are fully accessible only to authorized personnel. For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, you own the physical security for the local instance. Your data center is secured behind your company firewall.

In the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} network-within-a-network, the public network layer handles public traffic to hosted websites or online resources. The private network layer allows for true out-of-band management through a distinct stand-alone third carrier over SSL, PPTP, or IPSec VPN gateways. The data center to data center network layer provides free and secure connectivity between servers that are housed in separate {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} facilities.

Every {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} data center is fully secured with controls that meet SSAE 16 and industry-recognized requirements, without exceptions.

## Data security
{: #data-security}

With {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, securing your data against unauthorized access is a joint effort between {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and you.

Data that is associated with a running application can be in 1 of 3 states: data-in-transit, data-at-rest, and data-in-use.

<dl>
<dt>Data-in-transit</dt>
<dd>Data that is being transferred between nodes on a network.</dd>

<dt>Data-at-rest</dt>
<dd>Data that is stored.</dd>

<dt>Data-in-use</dt>
<dd>Data that is not currently stored, and is being acted upon at an endpoint.</dd>
</dl>

Each type of data needs to be considered when you plan for data security.

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform secures data-in-transit by securing the user access to the application by using SSL, through the network until the data reaches IBM DataPower Gateway at the boundary of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} internal network. IBM DataPower Gateway acts as a reverse proxy and provides SSL termination. From, there to the application IPSEC is used to secure the data as it travels from the IBM DataPower Gateway to the application.

Security for both data-in-use and data-at-rest is your responsibility as you develop your application. You can take advantage of several data-related services available in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog to help with these concerns.

## Security of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} applications
{: #application-security}

As an application developer, you must enable the security configurations, including application data protection, for your applications that run on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

You can use security capabilities that are provided by several {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services to secure your applications. All {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services that are produced by IBM follow IBM secure engineering development practices.

**Note:** Some of the services that are described here might not apply to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated or Local instances.
